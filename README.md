# Integrating a WordPress theme
Integration of a WordPress them for a client in the business of real estate

"Chalets and Caviar, an agency in Aspen, Colorado, has hired me to create their website. It has around 15 luxury chalets for sale and other chalets available to rent.They want a "clear, uncluttered, design that exudes luxury", the requirement is to offer them this result via a WordPress theme, customized so that the agency feels like their brand is well-represented. The agency has also requested a file explaining how to add, edit, and delete chalets from their listings."


The suggested WordPress theme will need installation and configuration and should be very elegant in design.
The website will contain chalets with a mix of sale and for rent.A contact page with contact details and a functional contact form
and a WordPress theme that makes logical sense for the client's requests.

This project includes :

A text file explaining which WordPress theme was chosen and why.


URL of the WordPress site: https://dev-hotels1.pantheonsite.io/


A CSS file of changes made to the theme


Wordpress PDF documentation of use to the agency
